Project Title: Will the customer accept the coupon?
Project Description: The project aims to understand coupon usage across a wide variety of variables including customer demographics, situational circumstances, and the location of coupon usage.

For example:
Visualizations were used to look at coupon usage my venue, and coupon usage based on the temperature.
Multiple queries were conducted to assess proportion of coupons accepted based on the bar subgroup.
Additional exploratory analyses repeated similar questions but for coffee house, and for high earners + expensive restaurants.
