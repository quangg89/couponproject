# Coupon Practical Application Project

# Context: 
The project aims to understand coupon usage across a wide variety of variables including customer demographics, situational circumstances, and the location of coupon usage.

# Observations:
While the highest number of coupons is used it coffee houses and restaurants <20, the highest acceptance rate is in carry out & takeaway and inexpensive restaurants. When looking at the hours for redemption, the younger demographic / post-work (e.g., 6pm) seems to be utilizers of the coupons.
Temperature can play a role in the coupons - sunnier weather isconnected with high coupon acceptance. 
Age also plays a role - where younger demographic is more likely to use the coupon, particularly those between 21-26. The demographic <21 years old also likely to accept -- this may make sense given economic position of the younger demographics.

# Example analyses: 
Visualizations were used to look at coupon usage my venue, and coupon usage based on the temperature.
Multiple queries were conducted to assess proportion of coupons accepted based on the bar subgroup.
Additional exploratory analyses repeated similar questions but for coffee house, and for high earners + expensive restaurants.
