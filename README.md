# Coupon Practical Application Project

# Context: 
The project aims to understand coupon usage across a wide variety of variables including customer demographics, situational circumstances, and the location of coupon usage.

# Observations:
While the highest number of coupons is used it coffee houses and restaurants <20, the highest acceptance rate is in carry out & takeaway and inexpensive restaurants. When looking at the hours for redemption, the younger demographic / post-work (e.g., 6pm) seems to be utilizers of the coupons.
Temperature can play a role in the coupons - sunnier weather is connected with high coupon acceptance. 
Age also plays a role - where younger demographic is more likely to use the coupon, particularly those between 21-26. The demographic <21 years old also likely to accept -- this may make sense given economic position of the younger demographics.
Frequency of visiting location plays a role on whether or not coupon may be accepted - this makes sense on the customer accepting to likely have an opportunity to use the coupon.
The acceptance of coupons by timing is connected to when you may visit these establishments - coffee houses from 10AM to early afternoon, and restaurants <20 + takeaway & carry after working hours, possibly on the way home. 

# Example analyses: 
Visualizations were used to look at coupon usage my venue, and coupon usage based on the temperature.
Multiple queries were conducted to assess proportion of coupons accepted based on the bar subgroup.
Additional exploratory analyses repeated similar questions but for coffee house, and for high earners + expensive restaurants.

# Next steps and recommendations: 
Further analyses could be informative - the data are currently limited by categorical demographics and could benefit from more specific input. Coupons are also administered in multiple ways - so combining datasets with utilization or "referral" source could provide a complementary approach to understand an overall coupon strategy. Internal data on the types of orders the coupons are used on could also drive a product-specific coupon strategy which may be further used to optimize coupon approach.
